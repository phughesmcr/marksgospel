41001001,"The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God."
41001002,"As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you, Who will prepare your way;"
41001003,"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make you ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight;"
41001004,"John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins."
41001005,"And there went out to him all the country of Judaea, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins."
41001006,"And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and had a leather belt around his waist, and did eat locusts and wild honey."
41001007,"And he preached, saying, There comes after me he that is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie."
41001008,I baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
41001009,"And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan."
41001010,"And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:"
41001011,"And a voice came out of the heavens, You are my beloved Son, in you I am well pleased."
41001012,And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
41001013,And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels served him.
41001014,"Now after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the good news of God,"
41001015,"and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent you, and believe in the good news."
41001016,"And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea: for they were fishers."
41001017,"And Jesus said to them, Follow me, and I will make you into fishers of men."
41001018,"And immediately they left the nets, and followed him."
41001019,"And going on a little further, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets."
41001020,"And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him."
41001021,And they go into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.
41001022,"And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes."
41001023,"And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,"
41001024,"saying, What have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God."
41001025,"And Jesus scolded him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him."
41001026,"And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him."
41001027,"And they were all amazed, so much so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."
41001028,And the report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.
41001029,"And immediately, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John."
41001030,Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and immediately they tell him of her:
41001031,"and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she served them."
41001032,"And at even, when the sun did set, they brought to him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons."
41001033,And all the city was gathered together at the door.
41001034,"And he healed many that were sick with many diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him."
41001035,"And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and there prayed."
41001036,And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;
41001037,"and they found him, and say to him, All are seeking you."
41001038,"And he said to them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end i came out."
41001039,"And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons."
41001040,"And there came to him a leper, begging him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If you will, you can make me clean."
41001041,"And being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, I will; be you made clean."
41001042,"And immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean."
41001043,"And he strictly instructed him, and immediately sent him out,"
41001044,"and said to him, See you say nothing to any man: but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
41001045,"But he went out, and began to announce it much, and to spread abroad the matter, so much so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in deserted places: and they came to him from every quarter."
41002001,"And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was rumored that he was in the house."
41002002,"And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room for them, no, not even about the door: and he spoke the word to them."
41002003,"And they come, bringing to him a man paralyzed, borne of four."
41002004,"And when they could not come near to him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed on which the paralyzed lay."
41002005,"And Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralyzed, Son, your sins are forgiven."
41002006,"But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and arguing in their hearts,"
41002007,"Why does this man so speak? he blasphemes: who can forgive sins but one, even God?"
41002008,"And immediately Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they so argued within themselves, said to them, Why argue you these things in your hearts?"
41002009,"Whether is easier, to say to the paralyzed, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?"
41002010,"But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins (he said to the paralyzed),"
41002011,"I say to you, Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."
41002012,"And he got up, and immediately took up the bed, and went out before them all; so much so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion."
41002013,"And he went out again by the sea side; and all the crowd gathered to him, and he taught them."
41002014,"And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the toll booth, and he said to him, Follow me. And he got up and followed him."
41002015,"And it came to pass, that he was sitting at table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him."
41002016,"And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, He eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners."
41002017,"And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, They that are whole have no need of a doctor, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."
41002018,"And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say to him, Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples fast not?"
41002019,"And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridal-chamber fast, while the groom is with them? as long as they have the groom with them, they cannot fast."
41002020,"But the days will come, when the groom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day."
41002021,"No man sews a piece of unprepared cloth on an old garment: else that which should fill it up takes from it, the new from the old, and a worse torn is made."
41002022,"And no man puts new wine into old wineskins: else the wine will burst the skins, and the wine perishes, and the skins: but they put new wine into fresh wineskins."
41002023,"And it came to pass, that he was going on the sabbath day through the cornfields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn."
41002024,"And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?"
41002025,"And he said to them, Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and they that were with him?"
41002026,"How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and did eat the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests, and gave also to them that were with him?"
41002027,"And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:"
41002028,so that the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.
41003001,And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had his hand withered.
41003002,"And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him."
41003003,"And he said to the man that had his hand withered, Stand up."
41003004,"And he said to them, Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill? But they held their peace."
41003005,"And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored."
41003006,"And the Pharisees went out, and immediately with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him."
41003007,"And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great crowd from Galilee followed: and from Judaea,"
41003008,"and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great crowd, hearing what great things he did, came to him."
41003009,"And he spoke to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should crowd him:"
41003010,for he had healed many; so much so that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him.
41003011,"And the unclean spirits, whensoever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, You are the Son of God."
41003012,And he instructed them much that they should not make him known.
41003013,"And he went up into the mountain, and calls to him whom he himself would: and they went to him."
41003014,"And he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,"
41003015,and to have authority to cast out demons:
41003016,and Simon he named Peter;
41003017,"and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and them he named Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:"
41003018,"and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,"
41003019,"and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. And he came into a house."
41003020,"And the crowd came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread."
41003021,"And when his friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself."
41003022,"And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the demons casts he out the demons."
41003023,"And he called them to him, and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?"
41003024,"And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
41003025,"And if a house be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand."
41003026,"And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end."
41003027,"But no one can enter into the house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house."
41003028,"Truly I say to you, All their sins will be forgiven to the sons of men, and their blasphemies whatever so they will blaspheme:"
41003029,"but whoever will blaspheme against the Holy Spirit has never forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin:"
41003030,"because they said, He has an unclean spirit."
41003031,"And there come his mother and his brothers; and, standing without, they sent to him, calling him."
41003032,"And a crowd was sitting about him; and they say to him, Behold, your mother and your brothers without seek for you."
41003033,"And he answered them, and said, Who is my mother and my brothers?"
41003034,"And looking round on them which sat round about him, he said, Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
41003035,"For whoever will do the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother."
41004001,"And again he began to teach by the sea side. And there is gathered to him a very great crowd, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the crowd were by the sea on the land."
41004002,"And he taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching,"
41004003,"Listen: Behold, the sower went out to sow:"
41004004,"and it came to pass, as he sowed, some seed fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured it."
41004005,"And other fell on the rocky ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:"
41004006,"and when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away."
41004007,"And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it gave no fruit."
41004008,"And others fell into the good ground, and gave fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought out, thirty times, and sixty times, and a hundred times."
41004009,"And he said, Who has ears to hear, let him hear."
41004010,"And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables."
41004011,"And he said to them, To you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all things are done in parables:"
41004012,"that seeing they may see, and not know; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest by chance they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them."
41004013,"And he said to them, Know you not this parable? and how will you know all the parables?"
41004014,The sower sows the word.
41004015,"And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately comes Satan, and takes away the word which has been sown in them."
41004016,"And these likewise are they that are sown upon the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy;"
41004017,"and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when trouble or persecution got up because of the word, immediately they stumble."
41004018,"And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word,"
41004019,"and the cares of the world, and the deceit of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."
41004020,"And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirty times, and sixty times, and a hundred times."
41004021,"And he said to them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bed, or under the bed, and not to be put on the stand?"
41004022,"For there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light."
41004023,"If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."
41004024,"And he said to them, Take notice what you hear: with what measure you use it will be measured to you: and more will be given to you."
41004025,"For he that has, to him will be given: and he that has not, from him will be taken away even that which he has."
41004026,"And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;"
41004027,"and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knows not how."
41004028,"The earth brings out fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear."
41004029,"But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts out the sickle, because the harvest is come."
41004030,"And he said, How will we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable will we set it out?"
41004031,"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth,"
41004032,"yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can stay under the shadow of it."
41004033,"And with many such parables spoke he the word to them, as they were able to hear it:"
41004034,and without a parable spoke he not to them: but privately to his own disciples he explained all things.
41004035,"And on that day, when even was come, he said to them, Let us go over to the other side."
41004036,"And leaving the crowd, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him."
41004037,"And there got up a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, so much so that the boat was now filling."
41004038,"And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say to him, Master, care you not that we perish?"
41004039,"And he awoke, and scolded the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm."
41004040,"And he said to them, Why are you fearful? have you not yet faith?"
41004041,"And they feared extremely, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
41005001,"And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes."
41005002,"And when he was come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,"
41005003,"who had his home in the tombs: and no man could any more bind him, no, not with a chain;"
41005004,"because that he had been often bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces: and no man had strength to tame him."
41005005,"And always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones."
41005006,"And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshipped him;"
41005007,"and crying out with a loud voice, he said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you by God, torment me not."
41005008,"For he said to him, Come out, you unclean spirit, out of the man."
41005009,"And he asked him, What is your name? And he said to him, My name is Legion; for we are many."
41005010,And he begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
41005011,Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of pigs feeding.
41005012,"And they begged him, saying, Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them."
41005013,"And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered into the pigs: and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, in number about two thousand; and they were choked in the sea."
41005014,"And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass."
41005015,"And they come to Jesus, and behold him that was possessed with demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, even him that had the legion: and they were afraid."
41005016,"And they that saw it declared to them how it befell him that was possessed with demons, and concerning the pigs."
41005017,And they began to beg him to leave from their borders.
41005018,"And as he was entering into the boat, he that had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him."
41005019,"And he suffered him not, but said to him, Go to your house to your friends, and tell them how great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you."
41005020,"And he went his way, and began to announce in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel."
41005021,"And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd was gathered to him: and he was by the sea."
41005022,"And there came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,"
41005023,"and pleading with him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: I pray you, that you come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made whole, and live."
41005024,"And he went with him; and a great crowd followed him, and they crowded him."
41005025,"And a woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,"
41005026,"and had suffered many things of many doctors, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,"
41005027,"having heard the things concerning Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment."
41005028,"For she said, If I touch but his garments, I will be made whole."
41005029,And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.
41005030,"And immediately Jesus, knowing in himself that the power originating from him had gone out, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments?"
41005031,"And his disciples said to him, You see the crowd crowding you, and say you, Who touched me?"
41005032,And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
41005033,"But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth."
41005034,"And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace, and be whole of your disease."
41005035,"While he yet spoke, they come from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying, Your daughter is dead: why trouble you the Master any further?"
41005036,"But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, said to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe."
41005037,"And he suffered no man to follow with him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James."
41005038,"And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he saw a riot, and many weeping and wailing greatly."
41005039,"And when he was entered in, he said to them, Why make you a riot, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleeps."
41005040,"And they laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all out, takes the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him, and went in where the child was."
41005041,"And taking the child by the hand, he said to her, Talitha cumi; which is, being translated means, Girl, I say to you, Arise."
41005042,"And immediately the girl rose up, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed immediately with a great amazement."
41005043,And he instructed them much that no man should know this: and he commanded that something should be given her to eat.
41006001,And he went out from there; and he came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
41006002,"And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, Where has this man these things? and, What is the wisdom that is given to this man, and what mean such mighty works done by his hands?"
41006003,"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him."
41006004,"And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house."
41006005,"And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick people, and healed them."
41006006,And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages teaching.
41006007,"And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out by two and two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits;"
41006008,"and he instructed them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no bread, no wallet, no money in their belt;"
41006009,"but to go clothed with sandals: and, said he, put not on two coats."
41006010,"And he said to them, Wherever you enter into a house, there stay till you leave there."
41006011,"And whatever place will not receive you, and they hear you not, as you go out there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony to them."
41006012,"And they went out, and preached that men should repent."
41006013,"And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them."
41006014,"And king Herod heard of it; for his name had become known: and he said, John the Baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him."
41006015,"But others said, It is Elijah. And others said, It is a prophet, even as one of the prophets."
41006016,"But Herod, when he heard of it, said, John, whom I beheaded, he is risen."
41006017,"For Herod himself had sent out and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had married her."
41006018,"For John said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife."
41006019,"And Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not;"
41006020,"for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous man and a holy, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was much bewildered; and he heard him gladly."
41006021,"And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, and the high captains, and the chief men of Galilee;"
41006022,"and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and them that sat at table with him; and the king said to the girl, Ask of me whatever you will, and I will give it you."
41006023,"And he swore to her, Whatever you will ask of me, I will give it you, to the half of my kingdom."
41006024,"And she went out, and said to her mother, What will I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist."
41006025,"And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, I will that you at once give me in a platter the head of John the Baptist."
41006026,"And the king was very sorry; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at table, he would not reject her."
41006027,"And immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring his head: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,"
41006028,"and brought his head in a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother."
41006029,"And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his body, and laid it in a tomb."
41006030,"And the apostles gather themselves together to Jesus; and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught."
41006031,"And he said to them, Come you yourselves privately into a deserted place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they had no opportunity so much as to eat."
41006032,And they went away in the boat to a deserted place privately.
41006033,"And the people saw them going, and many knew them, and they ran there together on foot from all the cities, and arrived before them."
41006034,"And he came out and saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things."
41006035,"And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, and said, The place is deserted, and the day is now far spent:"
41006036,"send them away, that they may go into the country and villages round about, and buy themselves something to eat."
41006037,"But he answered and said to them, Give you them to eat. And they say to him, Will we go and buy a year's wages worth of bread, and give them to eat?"
41006038,"And he said to them, How many loaves have you? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes."
41006039,And he commanded them that all should sit down by companies upon the green grass.
41006040,"And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties."
41006041,"And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves; and he gave to the disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all."
41006042,"And they did all eat, and were filled."
41006043,"And they took up broken pieces, twelve basketfuls, and also of the fishes."
41006044,And they that ate the loaves were five thousand men.
41006045,"And immediately he ordered his disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him to the other side to Bethsaida, while he himself sends the crowd away."
41006046,"And after he had taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray."
41006047,"And when even was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land."
41006048,"And seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was against to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea; and he would have passed by them:"
41006049,"but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was an ghost, and cried out:"
41006050,"for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid."
41006051,And he went up to them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were incredibly amazed in themselves;
41006052,"for they understood not concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened."
41006053,"And when they had crossed over, they came to the land to Gennesaret, and moored to the shore."
41006054,"And when they were come out of the boat, immediately the people knew him,"
41006055,"and ran round about that whole region, and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick, where they heard he was."
41006056,"And wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole."
41007001,"And there are gathered together to him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which had come from Jerusalem,"
41007002,"and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with impure, that is, unwashed, hands."
41007003,"For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands carefully, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders:"
41007004,"and when they come from the marketplace, except they wash themselves, they eat not: and many other things there be, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and brass jars."
41007005,"And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not your disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with impure hands?"
41007006,"And he said to them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honours me with their lips, But their heart is far from me."
41007007,"But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men."
41007008,"You leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men."
41007009,"And he said to them, Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition."
41007010,"For Moses said, Honour your father and your mother; and, He that speaks evil of father or mother, let him die the death:"
41007011,"but you say, If a man will say to his father or his mother, That whatever you might have been benefited by me is A gift, that is to say, Given to God;"
41007012,you no longer suffer him to do anything for his father or his mother;
41007013,"making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have delivered: and many such like things you do."
41007014,"And he called to him the crowd again, and said to them, Hear me all of you, and understand:"
41007015,"there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him: but the things which come out of the man are those that defile the man."
41007016,
41007017,"And when he was entered into the house from the crowd, his disciples asked of him the parable."
41007018,"And he said to them, Are you so without understanding also? Know you not, that whatever from without went into the man, it cannot defile him;"
41007019,"because it went not into his heart, but into his belly, and went out into the sewer? This he said, making all food clean."
41007020,"And he said, That which comes from out of the man, that defiles the man."
41007021,"For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts come, sexual immorality, thefts, murders, adulteries,"
41007022,"covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustfulness, an evil eye, evil speech, pride, foolishness:"
41007023,"all these evil things come from within, and defile the man."
41007024,"And from there he got up, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it: and he could not be hid."
41007025,"But immediately a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet."
41007026,"Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she begged him that he would cast out the devil out of her daughter."
41007027,"And he said to her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs."
41007028,"But she answered and said to him, Yes, Lord: even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs."
41007029,"And he said to her, For this saying go your way; the devil is gone out of your daughter."
41007030,"And she went away to her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the devil gone out."
41007031,"And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis."
41007032,"And they bring to him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beg him to lay his hand upon him."
41007033,"And he took him aside from the crowd privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue;"
41007034,"and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened."
41007035,"And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain."
41007036,"And he instructed them that they should tell no man: but the more he instructed them, so much the more a great deal they announced it."
41007037,"And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He has done all things well: he makes even the deaf to hear, and the mute to speak."
41008001,"In those days, when there was again a great crowd, and they had nothing to eat, he called to him his disciples, and said to them,"
41008002,"I have compassion on the crowd, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat:"
41008003,"and if I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint in the way; and some of them are come from far."
41008004,"And his disciples answered him, Where will one be able to fill these men with bread here in a deserted place?"
41008005,"And he asked them, How many loaves have you? And they said, Seven."
41008006,"And he commands the crowd to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; and they set them before the crowd."
41008007,"And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them."
41008008,"And they did eat, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets."
41008009,And they were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
41008010,"And immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha."
41008011,"And the Pharisees came out, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him."
41008012,"And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? truly I say to you, There will no sign be given to this generation."
41008013,"And he left them, and again entering into the boat departed to the other side."
41008014,And they forgot to take bread; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf.
41008015,"And he instructed them, saying, Take notice, beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod."
41008016,"And they argued one with another, saying, We have no bread."
41008017,"And Jesus knowing it said to them, Why argue you, because you have no bread? do you not yet know, neither understand? have you your heart hardened?"
41008018,"Having eyes, see you not? and having ears, hear you not? and do you not remember?"
41008019,"When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces took you up? They say to him, Twelve."
41008020,"And when the seven among the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces took you up? And they say to him, Seven."
41008021,"And he said to them, Do you not yet understand?"
41008022,"And they come to Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beg him to touch him."
41008023,"And he took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, See you anything?"
41008024,"And he looked up, and said, I see men; for I behold them as trees, walking."
41008025,"Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked intently, and was restored, and saw all things clearly."
41008026,"And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village."
41008027,"And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi: and in the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?"
41008028,"And they told him, saying, John the Baptist: and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets."
41008029,"And he asked them, But who say you that I am? Peter answered and said to him, You are the Christ."
41008030,And he instructed them that they should tell no man of him.
41008031,"And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again."
41008032,"And he spoke the saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him."
41008033,"But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, scolded Peter, and said, Get you behind me, Satan: for you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men."
41008034,"And he called to him the crowd with his disciples, and said to them, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."
41008035,For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the good news’s will save it.
41008036,"For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?"
41008037,For what should a man give in exchange for his life?
41008038,"For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man also will be ashamed of him, when he came in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
41009001,"And he said to them, Truly I say to you, There be some here of them that stand by, which will in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God come with power."
41009002,"And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John, and brings them up into a high mountain privately by themselves: and he was transfigured before them:"
41009003,"and his garments became dazzling, very white; so as no fuller on earth can whiten them."
41009004,And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
41009005,"And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
41009006,For he knew not what to answer; for they became incredibly afraid.
41009007,"And there came a cloud overshadowing them: and there came a voice out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son: hear you him."
41009008,"And suddenly looking round about, they saw no one any more, save Jesus only with themselves."
41009009,"And as they were coming down from the mountain, he instructed them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, save when the Son of man should have risen again from the dead."
41009010,"And they kept the saying, questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean."
41009011,"And they asked him, saying, The scribes say that Elijah must first come."
41009012,"And he said to them, Elijah indeed came first, and restores all things: and how is it written of the Son of man, that he should suffer many things and be set at nothing?"
41009013,"But I say to you, that Elijah is come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted, as it is written of him."
41009014,"And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd about them, and scribes questioning with them."
41009015,"And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him."
41009016,"And he asked them, What question you with them?"
41009017,"And one of the crowd answered him, Master, I brought to you my son, which has a mute spirit;"
41009018,"and wherever it takes him, it dashes him down: and he foams, and grinds his teeth, and seizes away: and I spoke to your disciples that they should cast it out; and they were not able."
41009019,"And he answered them and said, O faithless generation, how long will I be with you? how long will I bear with you? bring him to me."
41009020,"And they brought him to him: and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him severely; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming."
41009021,"And he asked his father, How long time is it since this has come to him? And he said, From a child."
41009022,"And often it has cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us."
41009023,"And Jesus said to him, If you can! All things are possible to him that believes."
41009024,"Immediately the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help you mine unbelief."
41009025,"And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he scolded the unclean spirit, saying to him, You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and enter no more into him."
41009026,"And having cried out, and torn him much, he came out: and the child became as one dead; so much so that the more part said, He is dead."
41009027,"But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he got up."
41009028,"And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, saying, We could not cast it out."
41009029,"And he said to them, This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer."
41009030,"And they went out from there, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it."
41009031,"For he taught his disciples, and said to them, The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he will rise again."
41009032,"But they understood not the saying, and were afraid to ask him."
41009033,"And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them, What were you arguing in the way?"
41009034,"But they held their peace: for they had disputed one with another in the way, who was the greatest."
41009035,"And he sat down, and called the twelve; and he said to them, If any man would be first, he will be last of all, and serve of all."
41009036,"And he took a little child, and set him in the midst of them: and taking him in his arms, he said to them,"
41009037,"Whoever will receive one of such little children in my name, receives me: and whoever receives me, receives not me, but him that sent me."
41009038,"John said to him, Master, we saw one casting out demons in your name: and we forbade him, because he followed not us."
41009039,"But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me."
41009040,For he that is not against us is for us.
41009041,"For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink, because you are Christ’s, truly I say to you, he will in no wise lose his reward."
41009042,"And whoever will cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea."
41009043,"And if your hand cause you to stumble, cut it off: it is good for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire."
41009044,
41009045,"And if your foot cause you to stumble, cut it off: it is good for you to enter into life halt, rather than having your two feet to be cast into hell."
41009046,
41009047,"And if your eye cause you to stumble, cast it out: it is good for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell;"
41009048,"where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched."
41009049,For every one will be salted with fire.
41009050,"Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its saltiness, whatever will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another."
41010001,"And he got up from there, and came into the borders of Judaea and beyond Jordan: and multitudes come together to him again; and, as he was accustomed, he taught them again."
41010002,"And there came to him Pharisees, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him."
41010003,"And he answered and said to them, What did Moses command you?"
41010004,"And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away."
41010005,"But Jesus said to them, For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment."
41010006,"But from the beginning of the creation, Male and female made he them."
41010007,"For this cause will a man leave his father and mother, and will be united to his wife;"
41010008,"and the two will become one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh."
41010009,"What therefore God has joined together, let not man put apart."
41010010,And in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter.
41010011,"And he said to them, Whoever will put away his wife, and marry another, commits adultery against her:"
41010012,"and if she herself will put away her husband, and marry another, she commits adultery."
41010013,"And they brought to him little children, that he should touch them: and the disciples scolded them."
41010014,"But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with anger, and said to them, Suffer the little children to come to me; forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God."
41010015,"Truly I say to you, Whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he will in no wise enter there."
41010016,"And he took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands upon them."
41010017,"And as he was going out into the way, there ran one to him, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what will I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
41010018,"And Jesus said to him, Why call you me good? none is good save one, even God."
41010019,"You know the commandments, Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honour your father and mother."
41010020,"And he said to him, Master, all these things have I kept from my youth."
41010021,"And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me."
41010022,"But his face fell at the saying, and he went away sorrowful: for he was one that had great possessions."
41010023,"And Jesus looked round about, and said to his disciples, How difficult it will be for they that have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!"
41010024,"And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answered again, and said to them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!"
41010025,"It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
41010026,"And they were astonished extremely, saying to him, Then who can be saved?"
41010027,"Jesus looking upon them said, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God."
41010028,"Peter began to say to him, Look, we have left all, and have followed you."
41010029,"Jesus said, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the good news’s sake,"
41010030,"but he will receive a hundred times now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life."
41010031,But many that are first will be last; and the last first.
41010032,"And they were in the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and they that followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were to happen to him,"
41010033,"saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles:"
41010034,"and they will mock him, and will spit upon him, and will scourge him, and will kill him; and after three days he will rise again."
41010035,"And there come near to him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying to him, Master, we would that you should do for us whatever we will ask of you."
41010036,"And he said to them, What would you that I should do for you?"
41010037,"And they said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your glory."
41010038,"But Jesus said to them, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"
41010039,"And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized with will you be baptized:"
41010040,but to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give: but it is for them for whom it has been prepared.
41010041,"And when the ten heard it, they began to be moved with anger concerning James and John."
41010042,"And Jesus called them to him, and said to them, You know that they which are considered to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them."
41010043,"But it is not so among you: but whoever would become great among you, will be your serve:"
41010044,"and whoever would be first among you, will be servant of all."
41010045,"For truly the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many."
41010046,"And they come to Jericho: and as he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great crowd, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the way side."
41010047,"And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me."
41010048,"And many scolded him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, You son of David, have mercy on me."
41010049,"And Jesus stood still, and said, Call you him. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Be of good cheer: rise, he calls you."
41010050,"And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus."
41010051,"And Jesus answered him, and said, What will you that I should do to you? And the blind man said to him, Teacher, that I may receive my sight."
41010052,"And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him in the way."
41011001,"And when they draw near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sends two of his disciples,"
41011002,"and said to them, Go your way into the village that is over against you: and immediately as you enter into it, you will find a colt tied, on which no man ever yet sat; untie him, and bring him."
41011003,"And if any one say to you, Why do you this? say you, The Lord has need of him; and immediately he will send him back here."
41011004,"And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street; and they untie him."
41011005,"And certain of them that stood there said to them, What do you, untying the colt?"
41011006,And they said to them even as Jesus had said: and they let them go.
41011007,"And they bring the colt to Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat upon him."
41011008,"And many spread their garments upon the way; and others branches, which they had cut from the fields."
41011009,"And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna; Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord:"
41011010,"Blessed is the kingdom that is coming, the kingdom of our father David: Hosanna in the highest."
41011011,"And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked round about upon all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve."
41011012,"And on the next day, when they were come out from Bethany, he was hungry."
41011013,"And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if by chance he might find anything on it: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs."
41011014,"And he answered and said to it, No man eat fruit from you from now on for ever. And his disciples heard it."
41011015,"And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;"
41011016,and he would not suffer that any man should carry a jar through the temple.
41011017,"And he taught, and said to them, Is it not written, My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but you have made it a den of robbers."
41011018,"And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the crowd was astonished at his teaching."
41011019,And every evening he went out out of the city.
41011020,"And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots."
41011021,"And Peter calling to memory said to him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which you cursed is withered away."
41011022,"And Jesus answering said to them, Have faith in God."
41011023,"Truly I say to you, Whoever will say to this mountain, Be you taken up and cast into the sea; and will not doubt in his heart, but will believe that what he said will come to pass; he will have it."
41011024,"Therefore I say to you, All things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you will have them."
41011025,"And whensoever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against any one; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."
41011026,
41011027,"And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;"
41011028,"and they said to him, By what authority do you these things? or who gave you this authority to do these things?"
41011029,"And Jesus said to them, I will ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
41011030,"The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me."
41011031,"And they argued with themselves, saying, If we will say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not believe him?"
41011032,"But should we say, From men—they feared the people: for all truly held John to be a prophet."
41011033,"And they answered Jesus and say, We know not. And Jesus said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things."
41012001,"And he began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and dug a pit for the winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to farmers, and went into another country."
41012002,"And at the season he sent to the farmers a servant, that he might receive from the farmers of the fruits of the vineyard."
41012003,"And they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty."
41012004,"And again he sent to them another servant; and him they wounded in the head, and handled shamefully."
41012005,"And he sent another; and him they killed: and many others; beating some, and killing some."
41012006,"He had yet one, a beloved son: he sent him last to them, saying, They will respect my son."
41012007,"But those farmers said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
41012008,"And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out out of the vineyard."
41012009,"What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others."
41012010,"Have you not read even this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner:"
41012011,"This was from the Lord, And it is marvelous in our eyes?"
41012012,"And they sought to lay hold on him; and they feared the crowd; for they knew that he spoke the parable against them: and they left him, and went away."
41012013,"And they send to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in talk."
41012014,"And when they were come, they say to him, Master, we know that you are true, and care not for any one: for you regard not the person of men, but of a truth you teach the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?"
41012015,"Will we give, or will we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why tempt you me? bring me a coin, that I may see it."
41012016,"And they brought it. And he said to them, Whose is this image and inscription? And they said to him, Caesar’s."
41012017,"And Jesus said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marveled greatly at him."
41012018,"And there come to him Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,"
41012019,"Master, Moses wrote to us, If a man’s brother die, and leave a wife behind him, and leave no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother."
41012020,"There were seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed;"
41012021,"and the second took her, and died, leaving no seed behind him; and the third likewise:"
41012022,and the seven left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.
41012023,In the resurrection whose wife will she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
41012024,"Jesus said to them, Is it not for this cause that you fall into error, that you know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?"
41012025,"For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels in heaven."
41012026,"But as touching the dead, that they are raised; have you not read in the book of Moses, in the place concerning the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?"
41012027,"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: you do greatly fall into error."
41012028,"And one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, What commandment is the first of all?"
41012029,"Jesus answered, The first is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is one:"
41012030,"and you will love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength."
41012031,"The second is this, You will love your neighbour as yourself. There is none other commandment greater than these."
41012032,"And the scribe said to him, Of a truth, Master, you have well said that he is one; and there is none other but he:"
41012033,"and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
41012034,"And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that dared ask him any question."
41012035,"And Jesus answered and said, as he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that the Christ is the son of David?"
41012036,"David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand, Till I make your enemies the footstool of your feet."
41012037,David himself calls him Lord; and where is he his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
41012038,"And in his teaching he said, Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and to have greetings in the marketplaces,"
41012039,"and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts:"
41012040,"they which devour widows’ houses, and for a show make long prayers; these will receive greater condemnation."
41012041,"And he sat down over against the treasury, and saw how the crowd cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much."
41012042,"And there came a poor widow, and she cast in two mites, which make a fraction of a day's wage."
41012043,"And he called to him his disciples, and said to them, Truly I say to you, This poor widow cast in more than all they which are casting into the treasury:"
41012044,"for they all did cast in of their excess; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living."
41013001,"And as he went out out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Master, behold, what manner of stones and what manner of buildings!"
41013002,"And Jesus said to him, See you these great buildings? there will not be left here one stone upon another, which will not be thrown down."
41013003,"And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,"
41013004,"Tell us, when will these things be? and what will be the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished?"
41013005,"And Jesus began to say to them, Take notice that no man lead you astray."
41013006,"Many will come in my name, saying, I am he; and will lead many astray."
41013007,"And when you will hear of wars and rumours of wars, be not troubled: these things must needs come to pass; but the end is not yet."
41013008,"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: there will be earthquakes in many places; there will be famines: these things are the beginning of labour pains."
41013009,"But take you notice to yourselves: for they will deliver you up to councils; and in synagogues will you be beaten; and before governors and kings will you stand for my sake, for a testimony to them."
41013010,And the good news must first be preached to all the nations.
41013011,"And when they lead you to judgment, and deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what you will speak: but whatever will be given you in that hour, that speak you: for it is not you that speak, but the Holy Spirit."
41013012,"And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death."
41013013,"And you will be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endures to the end, the same will be saved."
41013014,"But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where he should not (let him that reads understand), then let them that are in Judaea flee to the mountains:"
41013015,"and let him that is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house:"
41013016,and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloke.
41013017,But woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days!
41013018,And pray you that it be not in the winter.
41013019,"For those days will be trouble, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be."
41013020,"And except the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved: but for the chosen’s sake, whom he chose, he shortened the days."
41013021,"And then if any man will say to you, Look, here is the Christ; or, Look, there; believe it not:"
41013022,"for there will arise false Christs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, the chosen."
41013023,"But take you notice: behold, I have told you all things beforehand."
41013024,"But in those days, after that trouble, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light,"
41013025,"and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken."
41013026,And then will they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
41013027,"And then will he send out the angels, and will gather together his chosen from the four winds, from the farthest part of the earth to the farthest part of heaven."
41013028,"Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch is now become tender, and puts out its leaves, you know that the summer is near;"
41013029,"even so you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know you that he is near, even at the doors."
41013030,"Truly I say to you, This generation will not pass away, until all these things be accomplished."
41013031,Heaven and earth will pass away: but my words will not pass away.
41013032,"But of that day or that hour knows no one, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father."
41013033,"Take you notice, watch and pray: for you know not when the time is."
41013034,"It is as when a man, staying in another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, to each one his work, commanded also the porter to watch."
41013035,"Watch therefore: for you know not when the lord of the house will come, whether at even, or at midnight, or at the rooster's crowing, or in the morning;"
41013036,lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
41013037,"And what I say to you I say to all, Watch."
41014001,"Now after two days was the feast of the passover and the unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him with cunning, and kill him:"
41014002,"for they said, Not during the feast, lest by chance there will be a riot of the people."
41014003,"And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at table, there came a woman having an alabaster jar of ointment of perfume very costly; and she brake the jar, and poured it over his head."
41014004,"But there were some that had anger among themselves, saying, To what purpose has this waste of the ointment been made?"
41014005,"For this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they complained against her."
41014006,"But Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble you her? she has done a good work on me."
41014007,"For you have the poor always with you, and whensoever you will you can do them good: but me you have not always."
41014008,She has done what she could: she has anointed my body beforehand for the burying.
41014009,"And truly I say to you, Wherever the good news will be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this woman has done will be spoken of for a memorial of her."
41014010,"And Judas Iscariot, he that was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them."
41014011,"And they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently deliver him to them."
41014012,"And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his disciples say to him, Where will you that we go and make ready that you may eat the passover?"
41014013,"And he sends two of his disciples, and said to them, Go into the city, and there will meet you a man bearing a jug of water: follow him;"
41014014,"and wherever he will enter in, say to the owner of the house, The Master said, Where is my guest-room, where I will eat the passover with my disciples?"
41014015,And he will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready: and there make ready for us.
41014016,"And the disciples went out, and came into the city, and found as he had said to them: and they made ready the passover."
41014017,And when it was evening he came with the twelve.
41014018,"And as they sat and were eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, One of you will betray me, even he that eats with me."
41014019,"They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, Is it I?"
41014020,"And he said to them, It is one of the twelve, he that dips with me in the dish."
41014021,"For the Son of man went, as it is written of him: but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born."
41014022,"And as they were eating, he took bread, and when he had blessed, he brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take you: this is my body."
41014023,"And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them: and they all drank of it."
41014024,"And he said to them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many."
41014025,"Truly I say to you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
41014026,"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives."
41014027,"And Jesus said to them, All you will fall away: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered abroad."
41014028,"However, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."
41014029,"But Peter said to him, Although all will fall away, yet will not I."
41014030,"And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, will deny me three times."
41014031,"But he spoke very strongly, If I must die with you, I will not deny you. And likewise also said they all."
41014032,"And they come to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he said to his disciples, Sit you here, while I pray."
41014033,"And he takes with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly amazed, and incredibly troubled."
41014034,"And he said to them, My soul is very sorrowful even to death: stay you here, and watch."
41014035,"And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him."
41014036,"And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; remove this cup from me: however not what I will, but what you will."
41014037,"And he came, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, sleep you? could you not watch one hour?"
41014038,"Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
41014039,"And again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words."
41014040,"And again he came, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they knew not what to answer him."
41014041,"And he came the third time, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough; the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
41014042,"Arise, let us be going: behold, he that betrays me is at hand."
41014043,"And immediately, while he yet spoke, came Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders."
41014044,"Now he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whoever I will kiss, that is he; take him, and lead him away safely."
41014045,"And when he was come, immediately he came to him, and said, Rabbi; and kissed him."
41014046,"And they laid hands on him, and took him."
41014047,"But a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear."
41014048,"And Jesus answered and said to them, Are you come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves to seize me?"
41014049,"I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you took me not: but this is done that the scriptures might be fulfilled."
41014050,"And they all left him, and fled."
41014051,"And a certain young man followed with him, having a linen cloth cast about him, over his naked body: and they lay hold on him;"
41014052,"but he left the linen cloth, and fled naked."
41014053,And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
41014054,"And Peter had followed him afar off, even within, into the court of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire."
41014055,Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found it not.
41014056,"For many bare false witness against him, and their witness agreed not together."
41014057,"And there stood up certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,"
41014058,"We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands."
41014059,And not even so did their witness agree together.
41014060,"And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answer you nothing? what is it which these witness against you?"
41014061,"But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
41014062,"And Jesus said, I am: and you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."
41014063,"And the high priest torn his clothes, and said, What further need have we of witnesses?"
41014064,You have heard the blasphemy: what think you? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death.
41014065,"And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to hit him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the officers received him with blows of their hands."
41014066,"And as Peter was beneath in the court, there came one of the maids of the high priest;"
41014067,"and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, You also were with the Nazarene, even Jesus."
41014068,"But he denied, saying, I neither know, nor understand what you say: and he went out into the porch; and the rooster crowed."
41014069,"And the maid saw him, and began again to say to them that stood by, This is one of them."
41014070,"But he again denied it. And after a little while again they that stood by said to Peter, Of a truth you are one of them; for you are a Galilaean."
41014071,"But he began to curse, and to swear, I know not this man of whom you speak."
41014072,"And immediately the second time the rooster crowed. And Peter called to mind the word, how that Jesus said to him, Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times. And when he thought on it, he wept."
41015001,"And immediately in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a gathering, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate."
41015002,"And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answering said to him, You say."
41015003,And the chief priests accused him of many things.
41015004,"And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answer you nothing? behold how many things they accuse you of."
41015005,But Jesus no more answered anything; so much so that Pilate marveled.
41015006,"Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him."
41015007,"And there was one called Barabbas, lying bound with them that had made uprising, men who in the uprising had committed murder."
41015008,And the crowd went up and began to ask him to do as he was accustomed to do to them.
41015009,"And Pilate answered them, saying, Will you that I release to you the King of the Jews?"
41015010,For he knew that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.
41015011,"But the chief priests stirred up the crowd, that he should rather release Barabbas to them."
41015012,"And Pilate again answered and said to them, What then will I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?"
41015013,"And they cried out again, Crucify him."
41015014,"And Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out extremely, Crucify him."
41015015,"And Pilate, wishing to content the crowd, released to them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified."
41015016,"And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band."
41015017,"And they clothed him with imperial robes, and plaiting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;"
41015018,"and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!"
41015019,"And they struck his head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him."
41015020,"And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the imperial robes, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him."
41015021,"And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross."
41015022,"And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being translated means, The place of a skull."
41015023,And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh: but he received it not.
41015024,"And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take."
41015025,"And it was the third hour, and they crucified him."
41015026,"And the inscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
41015027,"And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left."
41015028,
41015029,"And they that passed by scoffed at him, shaking their heads, and saying, Ha! you that destroy the temple, and build it in three days,"
41015030,"save yourself, and come down from the cross."
41015031,"Likewise also the chief priests mocking him among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he cannot save."
41015032,"Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him insulted him."
41015033,"And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."
41015034,"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being translated means, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
41015035,"And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls Elijah."
41015036,"And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down."
41015037,"And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost."
41015038,And the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.
41015039,"And when the centurion, which stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God."
41015040,"And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;"
41015041,"who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women which came up with him to Jerusalem."
41015042,"And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,"
41015043,"there came Joseph of Arimathaea, a councillor of honourable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus."
41015044,"And Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling to him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead."
41015045,"And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph."
41015046,"And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been carved out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb."
41015047,And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
41016001,"And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him."
41016002,"And very early on the first day of the week, they come to the tomb when the sun was risen."
41016003,"And they were saying among themselves, Who will roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb?"
41016004,"and looking up, they see that the stone is rolled back: for it was very great."
41016005,"And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were amazed."
41016006,"And he said to them, Be not amazed: you seek Jesus, the Nazarene, which has been crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold, the place where they laid him!"
41016007,"But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He went before you into Galilee: there will you see him, as he said to you."
41016008,"And they went out, and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them: and they said nothing to any one; for they were afraid."
41016009,"Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons."
41016010,"She went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept."
41016011,"And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, did not believe."
41016012,"And after these things he was manifested in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country."
41016013,And they went away and told it to the rest: neither believed they them.
41016014,"And afterward he was manifested to the eleven themselves as they sat at table; and he scolded them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen."
41016015,"And he said to them, Go you into all the world, and preach the good news to the whole creation."
41016016,He that believes and is baptized will be saved; but he that does not believe will be condemned.
41016017,And these signs will follow them that believe: in my name will they cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;
41016018,"they will take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no wise hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover."
41016019,"So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God."
41016020,"And they went out, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen."
